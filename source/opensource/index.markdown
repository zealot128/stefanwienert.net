I published some libraries/Gems on Github.


<ul class='skills'>
<li> <strong><a href='https://github.com/zealot128/fontsquirrel-download'>FontSquirrel Kit Downloader for Rails</a></strong> Provides a Rake-Task for easy downloading/extracting/linking the great fontkits by Fontsquirrel for Rails 3.1+
</li>
<li> <strong><a href='https://github.com/zealot128/ruby-habtm-generator'>HABTM-migration generator for Rails</a></strong> Rails has a lot of generators, but missed one for generating Has-and-belongs-to-many intermediate tables. So I created this generator Gem.
</li>
<li> <strong><a href='https://github.com/zealot128/latex-thesis-template'>LaTeX Whitepaper template</a></strong> Battle-hardened by and improved through several theses, this is my boilerplate LaTeX-Template for creating thesis-like white-papers. It includes: Syntax-Highlighting through minted/pygments, index, glossary, two-page optimized stylings, natbib-style, Makefile, Epigraphs/Sidenotes for typographic ecstasy.
</li>
<li> <strong><a href='https://github.com/zealot128/flotr2-boxplot'>Flotr2-Chartplugin: Boxplot</a></strong> We needed a statistical box-plot with all the mean, whiskas stuff. Based on the very great Flotr2-library, this is my first Javascript (CoffeeScript) OS library.
</li>
<li> <strong><a href='https://github.com/zealot128/jekyll-reposter'>Jekyll Reposter</a></strong> Posting blog posts on several locations, I created this lib/plugin for the Jekyll/Octopress blog generator. With this, I can download posts from other blog on my blog easily (with canonical reference to the other).
</li>
</ul>
