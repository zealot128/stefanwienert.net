I am a web developer, living in Dresden, Germany and working as a lead developer at pludoni GmbH. With my [team][], I plan, create and maintain several web-applications for our company.

## Skills

<ul class='skills'>
<li> <strong>PHP</strong> I used to know PHP since I start to sprinkle some dynamic features to my homepage at that time. Compared to languages I know before, like Delphi, I was attracted by it's simple "deployment cycle", the plattform independence of web-apps and the rich (but messy) standard library.
</li>
<li> <strong>Drupal</strong> When starting my internship at pludoni GmbH, I learned the popular CMS Drupal, which is also based on PHP. Until today, I like to use it for "normal" websites, like company blogs. That is,  because of it's very good architecture, which balances complexity and simplicity very well. This also lead to a very rich ecosystem with modules for almost any use-case you can think of.
</li>
<li> <strong>Ruby</strong> I discovered Ruby in 2009 together with it's famous companion Ruby on Rails. Very fast, I start to love it's beautiful syntax and language features. To the present day, Ruby is my language of choice for web development and tools.
</li>
<li> <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> After working with PHP and Drupal, Ruby on Rails was quite a refreshment.The community is still very active and commited to the project, which lead to an incredible motivating ecosystem. I see Rails as my weapon of choice for WebApps that outreach standard use cases. Unfortunately, programmers for that framework are rare and the learning curve can be very steep with the newer Rails versions; HAML, Sass, Coffeescript, Rspec, Asset pipeline
</li>
<li>
<strong>Test/TDD</strong> When learning Ruby on Rails, sooner or later you will find about "Test driven development". This technique leads to an incredible motivating work rhythm and better code quality. I also wrote my diploma thesis about that technique. When testing Ruby on Rails apps, I use Rspec, shoulda, test/unit, factoryGirl, capybara-webkit, selenium and Cucumber.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Misc</strong> Aside above technologies, here is a list of buzzword-technologies, that I also know about or programmed in, but would'nt call be an expert (yet): Javascript, JQuery, Bash, SQL, CSS, Linux, Debian/Ubuntu, Delphi, C, Java
</li>
</ul>
