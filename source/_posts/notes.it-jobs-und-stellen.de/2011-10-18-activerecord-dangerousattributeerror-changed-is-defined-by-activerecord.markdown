```
ActiveRecord::DangerousAttributeError: changed?
```

 Columns named ```changed``` or ```valid``` causes this exception.
 To change that:


```ruby
class Node < ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.instance_method_already_implemented?(method_name)
    return true if method_name == 'changed'
    return true if method_name == 'changed?'
    super
  end

end
```

 But note, that this will influence the functionality of ActiveRecord (without changed? the API canâ€™t distinguish, if the model was changed or is valid etc.).
