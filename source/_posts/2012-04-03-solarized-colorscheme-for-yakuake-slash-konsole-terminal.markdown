The [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette, is a relativly new, but very popular one, which exists for a lot of editors, shells etc.
Unfortunatly, there seems to be no one for the Yakuake Terminal. No sooner said than done, I created one, which is hostet on Github

Here is a preview:
