<a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4b71657f01017crd.html">Every Chinese use 8 infusion bottles per year in avg</a><br/><p>A little strange for Germans: accoding to this blog, every Chinese uses about 8 bottles of infusion per year.</p>

<p>The reason is that the physicists get some bonus from the pharma companies, so it is common to get an infusion for even the slightiest illness.</p>

<p>Capitalism and health care, what a *great* combination.</p>
