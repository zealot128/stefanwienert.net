Standford University's teacher Dan Jurafsky and Chris Manning offer a public eLearning lecture about **Natural Language Processing** (NLP). NLP is about computers reading and understanding human language.
I decided to take part at this course, which happens to start this week.

The eLearning aspects are very interesting: Lecture takes part through short video lessons in easy digestable pieces of 10 minutes each. Additionally, one has to complete several programming tasks in either Java or Python. Good chance, to practice my Python again.

First week is about Regular Expressions and Tokenization, so some repetition for CS majors.

Very interesting, to see some new lecture forms like this!
