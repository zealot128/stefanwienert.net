I added a subpage [Stream](/stream) to my website, which includes the great [jQuery Lifestream Plugin](https://github.com/christianv/jquery-lifestream).

This provides a uniform interface for all my (public) online activity on a variety of websites, including Github, Stackoverflow, Twitter, Google+, posts from me on the pludoni corporate blog, Youtube and Last.FM.
