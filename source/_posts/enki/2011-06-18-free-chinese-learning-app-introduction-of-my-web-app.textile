Today, I want to introduce my online web-app for learning Chinese vocabulary. I wrote this some weeks ago, and until now I had a lot of fun, which I want to share with all the other Chinese learners.

For demonstration, I created a short screencast to show how easy it is to use.

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iwSKzGhCDDE?hl=de&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iwSKzGhCDDE?hl=de&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

In my opinion, this app helps a lot for a systematical learning of words

If you are a learner of the Chinese language, and also waste a lot of papers to train the writing, "give it a try!":http://shufa.stefanwienert.net

Languages available:

* English: Interface and word database
* German: Interface language only. Unfortunatly, I only found free-to-use dictionaries in English up to now.

Browsers tested:

* Firefox 4
* Chrome 13+

I am heavily motivated, to improve that app, so if you find any glitches or have some ideas, tell me at info@stefanwienert.net.
Coders can also send in bugreports (and bugfixes) at "GitHub":https://github.com/zealot128/ShuFaZuoPin
