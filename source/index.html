<div id="tag-cloud">{% tag_cloud %}</div>
  <p>Most recently, about: </p>
<section role='recent-posts' id='blog-archives'>
    {% for post in site.posts limit: site.recent_posts %}
    <article>
      {% include archive_post.html %}
      </article>
    {% endfor %}
</section>

This blog software is based on octopress, which is based on jekyll, which is an Ruby blogging-framework (for geeks). The background is a water color picture, which I bought in China.
